        <p class="article-paragraph">Goal of this project was a showcase of skills and understanding of how unreal
          material graph works,
          as well as general understanding of content creation pipelines involved in creating games.<br>
          The resulting material might not necessarily end up in any projects by itself,
          but the approach to creating it was as if it would be used in a game project.</p>
        <div class="image-format">

        <p class="caption-paragraph">Applied master material preview<br> (press to expand images)</p>
        <p class="article-paragraph">First, setting up pre-requisites and a scope, how I went step by step:</p>
        <ol class="article-list">
          <li>Determining a specific idea and an end goal. In this case, it was to create a MM that would be used by
            various props in a city environment.</li>
          <p class="caption-paragraph" style="margin-left: 0;">In this case, it’s something that I had to come up with
            based on my own judgement,
            in a real development environment this usually would be done in collaboration with art team to see, what
            specific needs they might have.</p>
          <li>The specific city environment as a reference was a more or less “out of the way” residential area of a
            European city (which I mostly went on location to gather some notes).</li>
          <li>With this, next thing to determine was a process of how assets are being added to the engine, and what
            specific ones I would have and be able to work with.</li>
          <li>Out of this, I determined which features I would want to have in this specific material, to narrow down
            the scope and features (listed below).</li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <p class="article-paragraph">The resulting MVP scope ended up being:</p>
        <ul class="article-list">
          <li>the assets to use would come from a model database/marketplace like sketchfab or fab, thus the material
            would need to be able to adapt to a lack of certain types of maps, or them being done in different way;
          </li>
          <p class="caption-paragraph" style="margin-left: 0;">While not necessarily applicable in bigger studios
            where the assets would either be done by internal artist team, or by an outsource, to a specific standard,
            it is closer to how a small/indie studio would operate, with purchasing/downloading “generalized” assets,
            which likely would require the additional adaptability</p>
          <li>the basics, for a PBR-oriented workflow - using base color, AO, Roughness, Metallic, normals, and some
            ability to control them;</li>
          <li>support for alpha and transparency masks (as it is expected that some assets, i.e. wire fences, bus
            stops and the like, might require it);</li>
          <li>support for emissives and emissive maps (as a lot of the street infrastructure can have glowing
            elements, like traffic lights, street lights, ATMs).</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="article-paragraph">After setting up the minimal scope, based on the notes and observations
          collected,
          a scope expansion was planned out, to be done once the MVP is finished (sorted from most needed to
          essentially “cool-to-have”s):</p>
        <ul class="article-list">
          <li>grime & dirt application on assets via a mask;</li>
          <li>automatic grime & dirt application near contact of the asset with a different surface;</li>
          <li>grime & dirt per-instance customization (ability to change parameters on individual actors on a level);
          </li>
          <li>paint & decals application on a material level (to apply things like graffiti or paint from inside a
            material)</li>
          <li>fully material-controlled traffic light (that one I just felt like being a little “extra”)</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="article-paragraph">With everything planned out, only thing left was to actually implement it.</p>

        <p class="article-paragraph">All of the MVP features were done as a material function,
          due to easier scalability for further feature additions, and expanded easier controls over UVs, which is
          then plugged as a material attribute inside a master material asset.</p>
        <p class="article-paragraph">Base color is set up with controls ranging from having just a full color fill, to
          having a base color texture,
          color tint and a mask for that color tint (meaning, if needed, a custom mask could be created to make more
          color variations of certain assets, while reusing the same base color texture).</p>

        <p class="article-paragraph">AO texture has additional controls to increase or decrease the amount and power
          of AO, for more artistic controls.</p>
        <p class="article-paragraph">Roughness controls switches between a roughness texture and a slider which sets a
          uniform value to the material.</p>
        <p class="caption-paragraph" style="margin-left: 7vw; margin-right: 15vw;">Ideally, with UE5 and while using
          Lumen, it should have additional controls to disallow pure black and pure white values, as, first, they are
          not proper PBR values most of the time, and second,
          having improper PBR values messes up how indirect lighting is calculated, resulting in possible artifacts.
          However, for purposes of this material, this was omitted.</p>
        <p class="article-paragraph">Metallic only switches between using a texture or not (mostly due to assets that
          are used only having metallic values if they have a texture for it)</p>
        <p class="article-paragraph">Normal has a setup to additionally blend in a tileable Detail map, as well as

          a mask, and parameters to control amounts and strength of those. Then function outputs the resulting base color texture, mask, and also strength, to be used inside the MMF 
          (base color going directly into the output, while mask and strength are used to modify metallic and roughness textures to account for how those would change with the surface becoming “dirtier”)</p>

          this setup is essentially just a gradient, but from testing, the difference wouldn’t be too noticeable, and it saves an extra texture sample.

        <h2 id="paint-and-decals" style="margin-left: 6vw;">Implementation - Paint & Decals</h2>
        <p class="article-paragraph">Basic idea for this was to have several slots to put any kind of decals directly inside material instance, 
          which would allow for that extra degree of customizability (feature was thought out after seeing a lot of things graffitied and covered in stickers/pamphlets/ads on the streets)
        </p>
        <p class="caption-paragraph" style="margin-left: 7vw; margin-right: 15vw;">Note: usually this kind of stuff would be applied as regular decals inside a level, 
          or just included in the base color texture at asset creation, but I thought it would be cool to have a feature like this inside a material.
        </p>
        <p class="article-paragraph">While the process of applying a single texture decal isn’t too different from how G&D was setup (in some parts, even simpler), 
          the extra complexity here came from the desire to have 5 total toggleable slots, all with its own scale, position, rotation and color controls.
        </p>

        </div>
        <p class="article-paragraph">Initially the idea was to have an individual function for a single decal, which is then copy-pasted inside a different P&D “control” function, 
          stacking those together, and then using this “control” inside master function to apply to base textures. However, due to the nature of how functions work with parameters and static switches, most of those 
          needed to be outside of the function, so individual function doesn’t really do much, and probably could be omitted entirely, but I decided it wasn't really worth it to remove those, and it wouldn't affect readability much.

        <p class="article-paragraph">Aside from that, it’s really straightforward, with chained base color and mask, and each decal having separate static switches, up to 5.
          After that, both are output and used inside master function, again in a similar way to G&D.

        <p class="article-paragraph">In the end result, every decal can be scaled, moved, rotated and painted. Potentially it could also have the ability to use custom primitive data, 
          but I decided not to because of the material already getting somewhat expensive with all features enabled.

        <p class="caption-paragraph" style="margin-right: 15vw;">Note: one pretty major downside of this approach 
          is being very dependent on how good the UV is unwrapped for assets, as the texture coordinate changes transforms based on those, so if there’s a particularly ugly seam, the decal would appear cut off, 
          but imo it still provides for some useful customization and artistic control.

        <h2 id="traffic-light" style="margin-left: 6vw;">Implementation - Traffic Light</h2>
        <p class="article-paragraph">Setup is done as both a separate function, and separate master material (as it is a specific feature for the traffic light, 
          it doesn’t need to be present on all other props, thus separate), and it expands and modifies material attributes that are being got from base master function.

        <p class="article-paragraph">The logic itself is essentially using a texture coordinate point to draw a circle, 
          and then using a stepping panner to move that circle between the points where the lights should be, which is used as an emissive mask.
        </p>
        <p class="caption-paragraph" style="margin-left: 7vw; margin-right: 15vw;">Note: as it’s a 3rd party asset, the UV unwrap for the lights wasn’t suited for this use, 
          but it was fortunate that the lights are at least at the same distance from each other in it. Basically meaning that there are a bunch of hard-set, non-reusable, values for scale, 
          jump location and starting position, and only the duration being a controllable parameter.

        <p class="article-paragraph">The color change is done with “if” which takes a value from the panner, which then uses base color to add an extra bit of texture, 
          to have a slight appearance of the light actually coming from behind the glass of a traffic light, instead of just being an emissive circles on top of it (even if it technically still is)

        <p class="article-paragraph">That is pretty much it for this master material.
          There are some thing which could be improved, mostly some additional features and controls, and some optimization regarding how decals are applied, how base textures are applied (as with proper workflow, even the unpacked 3rd party textures is best to just pack externally in some way), 
          and in general I didn’t really follow any naming conventions for the assets outside of materials themselves (textures specifically), but as this is intended to showcase the master material specifically, this was omitted for purposes of this work.
